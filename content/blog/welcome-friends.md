## Who are you even?

Well, that's a great question. Who am I exactly? My name is **Gonçalo Marantes**, I was born February 22nd, 1999 🎉 in **Porto, Portugal** 🇵🇹, so that makes me **21 years old** at the time of writing this article. I'm currently finishing my 4th year of my integrated master's degree in [Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/CUR_GERAL.CUR_VIEW?pv_curso_id=742) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto 🎓.

### What have you been up to?

Right now I've spent the last month studying for exams and finishing this project. Besides that there's nothing much to do, since the whole world is trying to survive a pandemic 🦠. (*I hope someone from the future is reading this and reminiscing from when we all thought the world was ending due to the coronavirus pandemic. How I envy you...*). Besides casually stressing out about college stuff (*exams, deliveries, unfinished projects, ...*) I spend a lot of my time working out 🏃 (*or at least I used to*), be it lifting weights 🏋️or kicking someone's ass 🥊 (*that someone being the heavy bag*).

During the pandemic I've become more of an outside person, it made me appreciate the outdoors ⛰️. So I take any opportunity to leave my house and explore 🗺️, at least I have a chance to take some awesome pictures 📷.

## What to expect from this blog?

After giving it some thought, I've decided that I'll treat this little space on the internet for... 🥁🥁🥁... anything really (*sorry for the suspense*). I'll treat this like a notebook, I will share life experiences, tech stuff, tutorials (*web development, design, hardware, software, ...*), or whatever else floats my boat ⛵.

So stay tuned and if you have any recommendations I would gladly accept them. Please feel free to open an issue on my [website repo](https://github.com/Marantesss/Marantesss.github.io) or drop me a line via e-mail.
